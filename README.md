# Restaurant App

This project contais a restaurant app which was supplied by by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) as part of their [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The website is written in html, css, and javascript. I contributed to this project with html and styling chancges to make the site accessible and responsive, as well as adding a service worker written in javascript to be used for cacheing of content and off-network use.

## How to run the application (from Udacity)

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5500` (or some other port, if port 5500 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 5500`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:5500`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
